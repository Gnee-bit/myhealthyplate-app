# Eatfit

*Your personal food health companion*

---

## Overview

Eatfit is a mobile application that helps you make informed food choices based on your unique health profile. Whether you're managing a chronic condition, dealing with food allergies, or simply want to eat healthier, Eatfit provides personalized insights to guide your dietary decisions.

---

## The Problem

What's "healthy" isn't the same for everyone. A food that's great for one person might be harmful to another due to:
- Chronic health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease)
- Food allergies and intolerances
- Specific dietary restrictions
- Personal health and fitness goals

Current nutrition information is generic,conflicting and doesn't account for individual needs, leaving people confused and making poor food choices.
